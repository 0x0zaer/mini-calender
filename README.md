Assignment: Mini Calendar Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
Objective:

In this assignment, you will create a Mini Calendar that displays the current day, date, month, and year dynamically using JavaScript. The calendar should be well-designed using CSS to enhance its appearance.
Instructions
1. HTML Structure:

    Create an index.html file.

    Inside the file, add a <div> container to hold the calendar.

    Use <span> or <p> tags inside the container to display:

        The day of the week (e.g., Monday)

        The numeric date (e.g., 27)

        The month (e.g., March)

        The year (e.g., 2025)

2. CSS Styling:

    Use CSS to style the mini calendar.

    Apply properties such as:

        Make the calendar responsive so that it looks good on all screen sizes.

        Font styles and alignment

        Padding and margins to keep the design clean

3. JavaScript Functionality:

    Create a script.js file.

    Use the Date() object in JavaScript to get the current date.

    Store the names of days and months in an array and use them to display the correct values.

    Use document.getElementById() or querySelector() to update the HTML content dynamically.
